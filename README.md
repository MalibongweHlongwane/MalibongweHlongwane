Hi there! 
I'm Malibongwe Hlongwane, a Data Analyst Intern, software engineer intern from Bergville, South Africa.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a Data Analyst Intern(Some Big Cool Financial Service Board That Shall Remain Unamed For Now) and Software Engineer Intern at @AATE.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and make tech-related TikToks (470,000 followers and counting).

Let's connect!
